Data and analyses of gas exchange rates in sweet birch

Foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) live within leaves without causing visible signs of disease in their host. FEFs occur in all vascular land plants, yet the exact nature of interactions between specific FEF taxa and their hosts is not well understood. Some FEF are associated with increased host fitness through enhanced water use efficiency, nutrient acquisition and production of defensive compounds. However, some FEF may become detrimental to the host under high-stress conditions. In 2022, we examined a series of leaf ecophysiological traits in sweet birch (Betula lenta, Fagaceae) along an elevation gradient, across three forested mountain slopes near Asheville, North Carolina, USA. We have a separate data set focused on FEF identification using morphotypes and Sanger sequencing of the ITS 1 and 2 regions. 

VARIABLES:

- FEFs: Foliar Fungal Endophytes.

- Site: 3 sites were studied, each site was a forested, south-facing mountain slope near Asheville, NC. Sites were spatially separated and had near identiacl elevational ranges: from 835 m to 1005 m above sea level. the three. The three sites are listed below by name:

  - SC: Shope Creek
  - GT: Green Top
  - BI: Big Ivy

- Tree: At each site, 10 Betula lenta (sweet birch) trees were haphazardly sampled at roughly even intervals along the elevational gradient. 

- Leaf: Three healthy-looking leaves were sampled on each tree, all from around eye level.

- Disc: Three discs were removed from each leaf (after surface sterilization) and placed on 2% malt agar media in individual petri dishes to culture out any         FEFs present.

- Photosynthetic rate: the rate of photosynthetic activity of an individual leaf, measured while the leaf was still on the tree.

- Transpiration rate: the rate of transpiration of an individual leaf, measured while the leaf was still on the tree.

- WUEi: Instantaneous Water Use Efficiency of an individual leaf, calculated from Photosynthetic rate/Transpiration rate for that leaf.

- Morphotype: An FEF that appeared visually distinct under a dissecting scope, used as a proxy for taxonomic group (i.e. fungal species).


STATISTICAL ANALYSIS:
Linear regression was used to look for correlations between elevation as an independent variable, and photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and WUEi, as the response variables. Nested ANOVAs were used to look for significant effects of Site, Tree(Site), and Leaf(Tree(Site)) on each leaf functional trait; photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, and WUEi. Tukey HSD tests were used to compute confidence intervals for differences between mean leaf functional traits in pairwise comparisons of Sites.
